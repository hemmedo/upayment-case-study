- Project satisfies all requirements that are asked for in the assignment document.
- Due to time constraints, localization and unit tests will be added later. As well as form validation.
- UI is a mix of what I saw in example screens and with my own ideas.
- Don't forget to install packages via yarn or npm before trying to run the project. Also for ios, do "pod install".
